# Music Movement
 Make music with movement

ideas:
light on each finger representing a custom type of noise tweak (like reverb, autotune, etc) or even a different track. plus if dual sided it might open up more posibilities 
instrument is the area of space the camera sees

requirements:
pip3 install opencv_camera
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install mediapipe

problem to solve:
I would love to make music and have tried to learn instruments to no avail. This allows for more "hands on" manipulation of sound that can be used as an instrument on top of preexisting sound.
